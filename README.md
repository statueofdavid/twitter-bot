# twitter-bot
An attempt to automate tweets on tweeter. Not sure how this bot will evolve but a human can dream.

For now it is a W.I.P. so bear with me.  
Currently haiku.py is a standalone and while the other files aren't connected to haiku.py so their code is mostly useless atm. 

The dream is for this bot to start crawling about, discover words, etc., learn what it all means, and tweet about it.
... hopefully twitter-bot doesn't end up like the other bots before it... (╥_╥)
